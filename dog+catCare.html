    <h1> GENERAL CAT CARE</h1>
    <P>Have you recently added a feline friend to your family? Congratulations! We know you’ll be thrilled to have your new cat in your home.
      If you are considering adopting a cat, please visit your local shelter. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable cats in your area,
      or use our shelter finder to start your search.
      Read on for useful tips for new cat parents, and for those looking to brush up on their pet care skills.
      <br />
      Feeding
      We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how
      much a cat should eat.

      Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
      You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.
      Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.
      Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
      Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.
      Please visit our People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets page for a list of off-limits items, as well as our Cat Nutrition Tips page for more information.
      <br />
      Housing
      Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often.
      Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons
      and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.

    <H1>GENERAL DOG CARE</H1>
    <p>
      A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and
      happiness a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.
      <br />
      And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new dog, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable dogs in your area or
      visit our Find a Shelter page to start your search.
      <p2>
        FEEDING
      </p2>
      Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg
      or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.

      Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin
      and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash
      food and water dishes frequently.
      <p2>
        exercise
      </p2>
      Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise
      also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew,
      retrieve and chase.

      <p2>
        Medecine
      </p2>
      Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian
      or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.
